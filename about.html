                with any
                member of your family at any time of the day or dropping a pic of a moment from your day.

                Of course, there are phone calls and texts.
                But sometimes people want to see other's faces and do activities together. Sending pictures to one
                another is a
                fantastic way to send love and get some face time in. Sending random photos of what the kids are up
                to might be
                a daily highlight for a lonely grandmother.

                the face to
                face conversation you will have with the ones you love.

                Simply click on the Virtual Visit tab and connect effortlessly.
                Keeping in touch with a grandmother, grandfather, Aunt or Uncle who is thousands of miles away
                doesn't mean
                a telephone call or in person visit anymore. You can connect in seconds and see their warm smiling
                faces
                instantly.
