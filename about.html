        <h1 class="head">
            What We Are About </h1>

        <p class="aboutp"> It’s important for families to understand the rationale for social
            distancing and how,
            even
            if
            someone
            doesn’t appear ill, they could still transmit the virus. It is also important for them to
            understand
            that social
            distancing is one step we can take in stopping the spread of the virus. Proctecting everyone
            is
            important.

            Family is important, make the most of every moment together near or far.
            <br>With
            F.U.N.
            you don't
            ever have to feel the distance of your loved ones again.

            Communication and staying in touch is important now more than ever. COVID-19 has impacted
            all of
            our
            families in many differnet ways, and staying in touch in an easy seamless way is vital.
            The idea of feeling connected is very
            reinforcing, to all of us, and it contributes to our happiness and mental well being.

        </h1>
        <P class="aboutp">
            As the novel coronavirus keeps us home, the lack of in-person human contact can cause stress
            and
            loneliness.
            Stay connected by hosting family game night right from the comfort of your couch, visting
            virtualy with any
            member of your family at any time of the day or dropping a pic of a moment from your day.

        <h1 class="head">Picture Share Room</h1>
        <p class="aboutp">
            Of course, there are phone calls and texts.
            But sometimes people want to see other's faces and do activities together. Sending pictures
            to one
            another
            is a
            fantastic way to send love and get some face time in. Sending random photos of what the kids
            are up
            to might
            be
            a daily highlight for a lonely grandmother.
