    <h1>Picture Share Room</h1>
    <p>
        Of course, there are phone calls and texts.
        But sometimes people want to see other's faces and do activities together. Sending pictures to one another is a
        fantastic way to send love and get some face time in. Sending random photos of what the kids are up to might be
        a daily highlight for a lonely grandmother.

        Simply click on the Virtual Visit tab and connect effortlessly.
        Keeping in touch with a grandmother, grandfather, Aunt or Uncle who is thousands of miles away doesn't mean
        a telephone call or in person visit anymore. You can connect in seconds and see their warm smiling faces
        instantly.
