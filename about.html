    <h1 class="head">Picture Share Room</h1>
    <p class="aboutp">
        Of course, there are phone calls and texts.
        But sometimes people want to see other's faces and do activities together. Sending pictures to one another is a
        fantastic way to send love and get some face time in. Sending random photos of what the kids are up to might be
        a daily highlight for a lonely grandmother.

    <h1 class="head">
        Virtual Visits </h1>

    <p class="aboutp">
        Connecting made easier. Connect with one or 20 family members, don't worry about anything other than the face to
        face conversation you will have with the ones you love.

        Simply click on the Virtual Visit tab and connect effortlessly.
        Keeping in touch with a grandmother, grandfather, Aunt or Uncle who is thousands of miles away doesn't mean
        a telephone call or in person visit anymore. You can connect in seconds and see their warm smiling faces
        instantly.
        <br>
        We offer video chatting, for one on one and group chats as large as you would like. No worries when using
        F.U.N., to stay in contact.
